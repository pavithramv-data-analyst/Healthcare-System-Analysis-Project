# Healthcare-System-Analytics-Project
# üè• Analysis of HealthCare System of California

This project provides an interactive analysis of California‚Äôs healthcare system, exploring hospital performance, patient outcomes, and cost trends.  
It is designed to help policy makers, administrators, and analysts identify gaps, improve care quality, and optimize resource allocation.

---

##  Project Overview
- **Healthcare Infrastructure**: Hospital distribution, bed capacity, and utilization rates.
- **Patient Outcomes**: Mortality, readmission, and recovery metrics.
- **Financial Insights**: Cost of care, reimbursement trends, and spending efficiency.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Performance across counties and health districts.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards.
- **Tableau**:interactive reports .
- **Excel / CSV Sources**: Initial data cleaning and validation.
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation before loading to Power BI.
- **Python**: Data Cleaning and data Transformation.

##  ETL & Data Preparation
1. **Extract** ‚Äì Gathered healthcare datasets (hospital stats, cost data, patient outcomes).
2. **Transform** ‚Äì Cleaned and shaped the data: handled missing values, standardized formats.
3. **Load** ‚Äì Built Power BI data model, created relationships, and implemented DAX calculations.

4. ### üîπ **Power BI Dashboard**
 - **https://github.com/pavithramv-data-analyst/Healthcare-System-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20HealthCare%20System%20of%20California.pbix**
  
   - 
##  Key Highlights
- Identified counties with **highest patient readmission rates** and potential causes.
- Revealed **cost variances** across similar treatment categories.
- Highlighted facilities with **exceptional outcomes** despite lower funding.

---

6. ##  Recommendations
- **Expand Preventive Care Programs**: Invest in community clinics to reduce avoidable ER visits and readmissions.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Redirect funding to counties with bed shortages and high patient-to-staff ratios.
- **Benchmark Best Practices**: Encourage underperforming hospitals to adopt processes from high-outcome facilities.
- **Control Costs**: Negotiate procurement and insurance contracts in regions with above-average treatment expenses.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrate live data feeds to track bed occupancy and patient outcomes continuously.

---

##  Conclusion
The analysis reveals both strengths and gaps in California‚Äôs healthcare system.  
By applying the above recommendations‚Äîespecially in preventative care, staffing optimization, and cost control‚Äîstate and local agencies can:
- Improve **patient outcomes** and satisfaction,
- Reduce **avoidable expenditures**, and
- Ensure **equitable access** to quality healthcare across all counties.
